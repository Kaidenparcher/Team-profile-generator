# Logo Generator

## Description 

This is a Node.js command-line application that prompts the user to input a short text string (up to three characters), text color, shape type, and shape color. Based on the user's input, the application creates a logo as an SVG file, using either a circle, triangle, or square shape with the specified color and the text string in the specified color at the center of the logo. The logo is saved as a file named "logo.svg" in the current directory, and a success message is printed to the console.

This project was a test of my ability! The testing process is very new to me and it took me a while to figure out, but with some help and refactoring, I was able to get them done. This project helped me sharpen my skills on testing and also constructors!
